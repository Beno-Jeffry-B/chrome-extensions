# Chrome Extensions Practice

This repository contains mini Chrome extension projects that I’ve built from scratch for learning and practice purposes.

Each folder includes a small standalone extension — from basic "Hello World" setups to simple functional tools.

## Purpose

- Practice Chrome Extension development
- Explore Manifest V3 features
- Learn by building from scratch

## Structure

Each subfolder is a separate mini project with its own `manifest.json` and source files.

## Note

These projects are for practice only and not meant for production use.
